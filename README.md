— *Billy Beane, Moneyball*

I’ve always loved baseball and numbers — and eventually that led me to coding.  
These days, I wrestle with logs in a backend bootcamp during the week,  
and on weekends I dive into KBO/MLB data, learning to “read baseball through data.”

I don’t just want to watch the game.  
I want to *understand* it — through numbers, patterns, and data.  
Somewhere along the way, I naturally found myself becoming a developer.

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
**Backend**  
`Java` `Python` `FastAPI`

**Data / ML**  
`Pandas` `Numpy` `Scikit-Learn`  
`Matplotlib` `Seaborn`

**Database**  
`MySQL` `SQLite`

## 🏟 Interests  
- Player development analysis  
- Game outcome prediction models  
- Tracking-data-based insights  
- “Moneyball-style” baseball interpretation  
- Backend × Sports data fusion projects  

---

## 🎯 What I'm Working On  
- Currently enrolled in a **6-month Backend Bootcamp**  
- KBO/MLB data crawling  


---

## 🎬 Why I Started Coding  
It all began with the movie **Moneyball**.  
“If you can’t beat them, change the rules.”

I’m not a former player or a scout,  
but I believe you *can* understand baseball through data.  
That belief is what pushed me to learn coding.  

I’m still a work in progress —  
but every day, I move one line of code forward.

## 📝 Future Projects  
- Win prediction ML model  
- Player comparison/ranking dashboard  
- Statcast-based hitting/pitching analysis  
- “Moneyball-style” scouting report generator  
- Sports data API backend service

### ⚾ “Understanding baseball through data, building baseball through code.”  
If I had to describe myself in one sentence, this would be it.
