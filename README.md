I’ve always loved baseball and numbers — and eventually that led me to coding.  
These days, I wrestle with logs in a backend bootcamp during the week,  
and on weekends I dive into KBO/MLB data, learning to “read baseball through data.”

I don’t just want to watch the game.  
I want to *understand* it — through numbers, patterns, and data.  
Somewhere along the way, I naturally found myself becoming a developer.

## 🎬 Why I Started Coding  
It all began with the movie **Moneyball**.  
“If you can’t beat them, change the rules.”

I’m not a former player or a scout,  
but I believe you *can* understand baseball through data.  
That belief is what pushed me to learn coding.  

I’m still a work in progress —  
but every day, I move one line of code forward.

### ⚾ “Understanding baseball through data, building baseball through code.”  
If I had to describe myself in one sentence, this would be it.
